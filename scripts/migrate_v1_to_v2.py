"""Template 1.xx -> 2.00: give every artefact a home.

`make template-update` refuses to cross a MAJOR release, because 2.00 MOVES directories and a
three-way merge cannot move a file. This script does the moving. It is deliberate, it is run once
per design, and it commits nothing — you read `git status`, run the gates, then commit.

What 2.00 changes, and what this script does about it:

| change | what happens here |
|---|---|
| `pdf/` -> `references/` | `git mv`, then every `pdf/INDEX.md` mention in the tree is repointed |
| the design of record moves into `signoff/` | the tree is created; a single frozen `decks/<ref>` is moved into `signoff/prelayout/decks` and `harness.yaml` repointed |
| layout artefacts leave the code directory | `layout/*.gds|*.png|drc*|lvs*|*.pex.sp` -> `signoff/layout/` |
| experiments name their phase | `**Phase:** <unset>` is inserted in every experiment README, and `Phase` added to `experiments_rows` |
| the package stops shimming stimulus/eye | NOTHING is deleted: a design that imports `<pkg>.eye` keeps its own copy and is told so |

    scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py --dry-run     # say what would move, touch nothing
    scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py               # do it; then `make lint && make test && make check`
